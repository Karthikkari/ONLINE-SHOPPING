Hello everyone!!,
The C code outlines an online shopping system with account creation, login, and item selection functionalities.
Users register with personal details and login using their mobile number and password.
They can shop for mobiles, watches, and earbuds, with each category offering various options with prices.
Items selected are added to a stack-based shopping cart.
Upon completion, users proceed to payment, with the system calculating the total payable amount.
Switch-case statements facilitate user interaction, and basic input validation ensures data integrity.
While functional, the system lacks advanced features like error handling and security measures.
It offers a structured interface for users to browse, add items, and complete transactions.
With potential enhancements, such as modularization and scalability improvements, it could provide a more robust and user-friendly shopping experience.
